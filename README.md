# NaiveTexter

#About
NaiveTexter is a freetext input spam identifier that uses a naive bayes classifier to identify which texts are 
categorised as spam and which are not.

For now the supervised learning uses the spambase database to illustrate the principle of the algorithm.
Future releases should use a better, more updated database and learn from user input.

The thought is to expand this web-application with more machine-learning methods to identify spam messages.
The application can then be used to compare different machine-learning methods that identifies spam from given texts.
